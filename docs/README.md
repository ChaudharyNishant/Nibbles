The snake continuously moves and you have to collect the points which will help the snake grow. The snake dies if it touches the wall or tries to go throw itself. There are some bonuses too in the game. They can make the snake faster, slower, grow the snake drastically etc. Play this addictive game and make the snake occupy all of the space of the box.
